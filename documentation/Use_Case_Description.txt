Use Case Title:
Real-Time Healthcare Facility Disruption Navigator – Halifax, NS

Background:
In Halifax, Nova Scotia, residents often face difficulties in accessing urgent care due to unanticipated facility disruptions such as emergency room closures, walk-in clinic overloads, or adverse weather and traffic conditions. These barriers can delay treatment during critical situations. Additionally, many residents lack a family doctor or are unfamiliar with nearby care options.

User Persona:
- Residents of Halifax, especially those without a family physician
- Individuals experiencing urgent symptoms or needing same-day care
- People who rely on public health alerts or live near known landmarks (e.g., Halifax Shopping Centre)

Pain Points:
- Lack of real-time visibility into urgent care availability or closures
- Confusion about where to go when one facility is closed or full
- Difficulty finding trusted, up-to-date information quickly
- No easy way to assess access issues like traffic or weather-related barriers

Success Criteria:
- The chatbot accurately informs users of real-time facility closures or disruptions
- It offers alternative care location suggestions based on user landmarks or areas
- It provides clear, calm instructions when users describe symptoms of a medical emergency
