# Case 25 â€“ Real-Time Healthcare Facility Disruption Chatbot (Halifax, NS)

ðŸ“– Scenario Background
In Halifax, Nova Scotia, severe weather events, power outages, and staffing shortages can cause sudden
closures or service disruptions at hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Timely and accurate communication helps
patients plan their care and avoid unnecessary travel. Nova Scotia Health, the provincial government, and
emergency management organizations provide real-time alerts and facility status updates. This scenario asks
students to use the Ollama + AnythingLLM stack, combined with locally available, authoritative health
education materials, to design a chatbot for Real-Time Healthcare Facility Disruption and Closure
Announcements.
ðŸŽ¯ Scenario Goals
Help users access up-to-date information about local healthcare facility closures or service disruptions
Provide guidance on alternative care options during closures
Clearly communicate that the chatbot does not provide professional medical diagnoses
